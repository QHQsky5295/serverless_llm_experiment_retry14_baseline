## Mainline ledger

| Block | Status | Evidence / next action |
|---|---|---|
| Approved plan persistence | Recorded | Full snapshot + source hash + AGENTS instructions |
| Resource containment / safety | Basic primitives and native Ray inheritance passed; production gates pending | Two actual Ray 2.54 workers inherit limits and exit cleanly. Tiny-scope and socket-path failed attempts retained. CPU proof is affinity, not delegated cpuset |
| Protected historical artifacts | Sealed and verified | `paper_results/ieee_tc/safety/20260925_execution_start_protected.json`; old results and selected user modifications unchanged |
| Remote authentication / management | Key login verified; service qualification pending | Strict host checking, dedicated restricted key; remote disk 138.9 GiB below 150 GiB floor, user decision pending. See REMOTE_ACCESS.md |
| P0 main-table / Full provenance | 7B source-pair audit complete | Same trace/subset SHA, different execution; 202 scalar fields preserved. P0_FULL_PROVENANCE.md; no performance rerun needed for this finding |
| Serverless wait audit | Historical audit + no-GPU control-path tests complete | Clean 7B/3B logs reused; six real-method AST tests pass; incremental ready-before-wait patch preserved. Model pair pending |
| P1 IEEE semantic alignment | Nine-equation audit recorded; exact arrival demand implemented and tested | P1_FORMULA_IMPLEMENTATION.md. 297 combined tests pass. Routing/class EWMA, planner objective, admission and physical reservations remain open; no Full performance qualification |
| P2 backend qualification | Pending | vLLM candidate must be checked locally |
| Baseline qualification | Pending | Serverless, vLLM, S-LoRA, dLoRA 3B, Loquetier, HydraServe |
| M1 / M2 | Not started | No new formal performance claims |
| A1–A5, S1–S3 | Not started | Shared frozen policies required |
| S4–S13 + offline supplements | Not started | Follow core experiments |
| Documents / final curated figures | Not started | Per-run figures/tables start with the first evidence block |

## Reporting and backup cadence

- While actively working, concise user updates at least once per minute.
- After each completed experiment group and at least every 30 minutes of active
  work: completed evidence / current research question and reason / remaining work.
- Tested milestone commits: safety/protocol, Serverless audit/repair, IEEE + backend,
  baseline qualification, each main/ablation/sensitivity evidence block.
- Stage named task files only. Verify pushed remote commit IDs. Preserve failures.
- Resume by reading the plan and this ledger, inspecting processes and current Git
  state, then doing the next unmet gate; do not restart live work from stale notes.

## Pre-existing changes (do not stage)

Main: generated LoRA manifest, AAAI review archive/directory, old figs/paper
untracked artifacts, scripts/regenerate_motivation_figs.py.

Baseline: scripts/replay_openai_trace.py,
scripts/run_serverlessllm_relayserve_continuation.sh, cache/, installs/, repos/,
configs/relayserve_motivation_serverlessllm.yaml.

## Immediate next actions

1. Align F/DP and routing/admission using the nine-equation audit. Demand checkpoint passed all 297 tests. This advances the mainline while remote disk approval is pending.
2. Integrate effective service-worker and external-watchdog checks into existing launchers; native single-raylet witness is not the full deployment gate. Qualify Serverless native checkpoint path before its original/repaired model pair.
3. Continue remote setup after its disk gate; no heavy GPU run
   until actual process containment and watchdog gates are satisfied.

## Verified backups

- Main `a022340f014ab2a115bbab79841638ec6c15d1ae` pushed to
  `faaslora_origin/retry14_continuous_queue_v2`; remote SHA checked.
- Baseline `2353e7e0c7af7cfd0bfb43a4913c9178da391e34` pushed to `origin/main`;
  remote SHA checked. No pre-existing user changes staged.
- Baseline audit/repair checkpoint `f40eff06ad1a31d17fe05b12405d74b8a6a7bf70`
  pushed to `origin/main`; main audit bundle corresponds to this implementation.
- Main diagnostic bundle `9e7a73209b8da4a9006c1e2951fc26038301b167`
  pushed to V2; remote SHA verified.
- Main native-worker safety checkpoint `040296e6ee424a3f9ff37c40ca39da7ee4b8432c`
  and baseline loader audit `45698053fb48ab2219ccde9253e4754e28d68a63`
  pushed to their respective branches; remote SHAs verified.

## Serverless evidence checkpoint (provisional model-level attribution)

- Recomputed clean 7B and 3B raw logs, 4,000 successful recorded requests each.
  Median backend-start gaps: 1.002267 s / 1.002198 s; router queue mean:
  236.666 s / 237.200 s. Historical runs are R2 relative to the TC contract.
- Official method with two ready replicas incurs one wait per request;
  minimal repaired method preserves a,b,a,b RR and has no ready-path wait.
- Six no-GPU method tests pass (ready, empty, full, cancellation). Full inference
  cancellation/scale-down and real model pairs are still required.
- Source environment not synchronized/overwritten; vendor's pre-existing staged
  changes preserved; only incremental router change is new in its worktree.
- Existing summarizer extended, not replaced. Plotting extends existing figure
  script. Initial render attempt found matplotlib absent in the inference env;
  use an existing plotting environment, do not install into frozen inference env.
- Plotting uses existing conda base with matplotlib 3.10.0; installed Times New
  Roman faces registered explicitly. Two r2 figures rendered and visually checked,
  3.45-inch width, source data/hashes retained; old figures untouched.
- Existing Serverless launcher uses global tmux and cleanup includes global
  Ray-stop/pkill paths. Do NOT use that path for TC: isolate the session server,
  contain actual workers and scope cleanup to this run before any model pilot.

## Completed evidence: foundational safety (not performance)

- Eight resource-policy/protection unit tests passed.
- Existing stable-environment basic smoke suite: 288 tests passed in 26.917 s.
- First tiny allocation test was throttled at `memory.high` and timed out before
  reaching `memory.max`: 1,737 high events, no OOM. Failure preserved.
- Second test separated hard-limit behavior (128 MiB high=max), verified an
  in-scope OOM kill, child inheritance and cleanup. Production limits unchanged.
- Delegated controllers currently expose memory/pids, not cpuset; do not claim
  CPU controller isolation from accepted systemd properties alone.
- Native Ray 2.54.0 witness: two distinct actors in a 2/3 GiB high/max scope,
  128 MiB object store, no GPUs; actual PID cgroups and affinity agree. Both
  worker PIDs and their scope were absent after cleanup. First attempt failed
  from AF_UNIX path length before worker launch; retained as launcher error.
- No formal GPU run has started. No performance claim follows from these checks.

## P1 demand checkpoint

- Exact ingress-based window fractions replace per-adapter accumulating EWMA /
  doubled registry values; immutable epoch snapshot available to the planner.
- No-GPU reproduction: two equal arrivals previously returned .2/.2 from getter
  and 1/1 from registry; expiry did not clear getter/top-k. Expected .5/.5 then 0/0.
- First full regression had five fixture errors: synthetic stacks bypassed
  construction and omitted the authoritative demand provider. Fixtures now provide
  it explicitly; no production fallback was added to make tests pass.
- 288 existing smoke + 9 exact-demand tests = 297 passed, zero skips/failures.
- All 147 sealed historical entries unchanged after tests. Models were mocked;
  four real GPUs remained idle. No workload/adapter regeneration occurred.
- Nine-formula gap table is an evidence table, not an experimental performance
  figure. No claim that P1, Full qualification or optimization target is complete.
